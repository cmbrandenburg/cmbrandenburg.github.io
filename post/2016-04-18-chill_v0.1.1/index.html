  <h1>Announcing Chill v0.1.1</h1>

  <em>Monday, Apr 18, 2016</em>

  <p>Chill v0.1.1 is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/chill">now available</a>. Chill is a client-side
CouchDB library for the Rust programming language.</p>

<p>This release adds support for executing views, meaning an application
using Chill can now use CouchDB for interesting work&mdash;and not
merely as a document store.</p>

<p>This release also adds support for manipulating attachments&mdash;though
only indirectly, as a consequence of actions that read or update
documents. For example, an application can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read a document from the CouchDB server,</li>
<li>Insert an attachment to the application&rsquo;s in-memory representation of
the document, and,</li>
<li>Update the document by sending the updated representation to the
CouchDB server.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consequently, the CouchDB server will contain the new attachment.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the full <a href="https://github.com/chill-rs/chill/blob/v0.1.1/CHANGELOG.md">change_log</a>.</p>

<p>My aim for future releases is to stick to a three-week release train,
with each release containing whichever changes happen to make it in to
the master branch during that time. I believe this schedule will work
well until Chill provides broad coverage of the CouchDB API.</p>
