Chill v0.1.1 is [now available][chill_crates_io]. Chill is a client-side
CouchDB library for the Rust programming language.

This release adds support for executing views, meaning an application
using Chill can now use CouchDB for interesting work&mdash;and not
merely as a document store.

This release also adds support for manipulating attachments&mdash;though
only indirectly, as a consequence of actions that read or update
documents. For example, an application can:

1. Read a document from the CouchDB server,
2. Insert an attachment to the application's in-memory representation of
   the document, and,
3. Update the document by sending the updated representation to the
   CouchDB server.

Consequently, the CouchDB server will contain the new attachment.

Here's the full [change_log][chill_v0_1_1_change_log].

My aim for future releases is to stick to a three-week release train,
with each release containing whichever changes happen to make it in to
the master branch during that time. I believe this schedule will work
well until Chill provides broad coverage of the CouchDB API.
