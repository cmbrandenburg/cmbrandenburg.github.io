# BoltDB vs LMDB

# BoltDB and LMDB similarities

* Both are **local key-value stores**—i.e., server-free, schema-free,
  non-relational, and typically *fast*.

* Both are **memory-mapped**—i.e., small databases reside in memory but
  databases can be bigger than the sum of physical memory and swap space.

* Both store data using a **B+tree** and provide **ACID** and **MVCC**
  semantics.

* Both provide **shared reading** and **exclusive writing**, relying on
  **explicit transactions**.

* BoltDB originally was a port of LMDB.

---

# Terminology interlude

* BoltDB has a **database** containing **buckets** containing key-value
  **items**.

* LMDB has an **environment** containing **databases** containing key-value
  **items**.

As an analogy:

* SQL has a **database** containing **tables** containing **rows**.

---

# BoltDB advantages

* BoltDB is **pure Go**, which is more convenient for the typical Go programmer.

* BoltDB supports **nested buckets**, making it convenient for hierarchical
  information.

* BoltDB has a **very simple API** that is pleasant to use.

---

# LMDB advantages

* LMDB is generally **faster**.

* LMDB provides optimization features, such as **integer keys**.

* LMDB supports **duplicate keys**.

* LMDB allows for multiple readers and one writer **simultaneously**—i.e.,
  readers never get locked out.

* LMDB has bindings for **many languages**: C, Go, Python, Rust, etc.
